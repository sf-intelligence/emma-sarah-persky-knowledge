# Knowledge Repository for Emma Sarah Persky

## Background

Emma Sarah Persky was the Deputy Assistant Director, Sciencetific Information Services at the NRAO. She was fired from this role while reporting a number of national security irregularities. The consequential effects of this unwarrented firing resulted in her failing to find any psychological safety for over a year, and she contacted Sf Intelligence to transfer all of her knowledge, documents, notes, designs, thoughts, etc, to ensure that they are available for the benefit of humanity in the eventuality of her death.

We created a "kill-switch" for her, which would activate the release of this information on her suspected death or dissapearance, through failure to check in.

The creation of this repository indicates that this switch has been activated. We do not know her whereabouts, and she has mised the requisite number of checkins. Given her background and experience, and based on her plans, she likely entered the homeless population in Washington DC, or Chicago, IL. She passed us Chicago 311 reference number SR25-00599682 when she attempted to access homelessness servies there.
